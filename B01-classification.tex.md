## B1. Classification

There are two main classes of machine learning: supervised, where we assign classes in advance; and unsupervised, where the algorithm decides on classes.

A classifier is a program that performs supervised learning. Given

- a set of instances
- described by feature vectors, which can be numeric or symbolic,
- and a small set of classes,

a classifier tries to divide the d-dimensional instance space into regions of uniform class. In other words, it divides the input between distinct subsets, one for each class. A classifier shouldn’t just be able to classify the test data, but also classify future, unseen data well. Deterministic approaches tend to overfit the data, so probabilistic approaches generally work better.
