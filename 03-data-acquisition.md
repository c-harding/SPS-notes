# Symbols, Patterns and Signals

## 3. Data acquisition

We get data from the real world using an *acquisition process*. Sometimes this is straight-forward data collection (questionaires, surveys, measurements, etc.). At other times, we need more complex application-specific processes, e.g. DNA sequencing. Most of this is out of the remit of this unit, with the exception of acquisition of signals: speech, audio, video.

### Digital representation

We can produce a digital representation of analogue data using sampling and quantisation. This means taking a sample of the data at regular intervals, and *quantising* = rounding the data to the nearest quantisation level. The picture below shows three bits = (2Â³ = 8) quantisation levels.
