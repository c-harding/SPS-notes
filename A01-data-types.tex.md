# Symbols, Patterns and Signals

## A1. Data types

There are four main categories of data: numeric and symbolic sequences and lists. Symbolic means there’s no inherit order to the units, whereas numeric data units can be compared and manipulated arithmetically. Sequences are ordered collections of data units, whereas lists are unordered collections.

- **Numeric sequences**: speech samples, images, video
- **Numeric lists**: exam marks, sample measurements
- **Symbolic sequences**: DNA sequences, words in a text
- **Symbolic Lists**: student records, consumer surveys

### Patterns

Patterns are structured collections of elements, e.g. letters, pixels, acoustic vectors, DNA bases, etc. They are often what we want to detect or recognise in order to interpret and make decisions.

They may be already ‘visible’ in the data (e.g. part of an image), or the task may be to identify them, e.g. in symbolic lists.
