## 4. Distance

Distance is a measure of separation between data. It can be defined for inividual data units, or for sequences/lists. It is important, as it allows for data to be ordered, and so allows numeric calculations.

### Distance measure

For a distance measure $D(a,b)$ to be valid, it must have the following properties:

- nonnegativity: $D(a,b) ≥ 0$
- reflexivity: $D(a,b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow a = b$
- symmetry: $D(a,b) = D(b,a)$
- triangle inequality: $D(a,b) + D(b,c) ‏≥ D(a,c)$
